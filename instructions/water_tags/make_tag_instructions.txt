Steps for setting up a water tracer simulation in iCESM1.2:

1.  First, turn on water isotopes by following the instructions listed in
    "water_isotope_instructions.txt" present in the "water_isotopes" instructions directory.
    However, do not build the model until the water tracer additions below have
    also been added.

2.  Next, set up the script make_tag.sh 
	User defined input: location tags, lat&lon, output tracer tags for targed regions
	non-user defined input: fortran code atm_comp_mct_template_F90 
	Execution: ./make_tag.sh 
	outputs: atm_comp_mct.F90, which incorporate a section of code to tag water species evaporated from different regions; user_nl_cam, which sets up the namelist for tagged water species

3.  Then, add the line "-water_tag_num N" to the "CAM_CONFIG_OPTS" variable in your case's env_build.xml
    file, where "N" is the number of water tracers you are using. You can find total number of water species M in atm_comp_mct.F90. N = M - 4 (the 4 species H2O, H216O, H218O and HDO are the default, not tagged species)

4.  Finally, copy "user_nl_cam" file into your case directory and add other user-defined namelist settings if any.
    In user_nl_cam, for every new water tracer that is added, location tags and tracer names are specified.
    An additional 7 "H2O" quantities are added to the "wtrc_species_names" variable, and an additional series of "VAPOR, LIQUID, ICE, etc." to the "wtrc_type_names" variable.

5.  Build the model (run *.build script in case directory).

6.  Run the model  (use either the *.run or *.submit script in case directory).

7.  Once the model is finished running, you should find variables with the same names you provided in user_nl_cam
    in the history files that contain the associated water mass quantities for your water tracer.

Good luck!
