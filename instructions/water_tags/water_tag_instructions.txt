Steps for setting up a water tracer simulation in iCESM1.2:

1.  First, turn on water isotopes by following the instructions listed in
    "water_isotope_instructions.txt" present in the "water_isotopes" instructions directory.
    However, do not build the model until the water tracer additions below have
    also been added.

2.  Next, set up the script "make_tag.sh" 
    User defined input: 
	"tracking": which isotopologues to track (isph2o isph216o isphdo isph218o), 1 to include, 0 to exclude
	"topetags": tracer tags for "user_nl_cam" and history file, corresponding to included tracking
	"loctags": regions tags for "user_nl_cam" and history file
	"ifocn","iflnd","ifice": whether to tag evaporation from ocean, land or ice
	"lat&lon": upper and lower bounds of latitude and longitude for each region in "loctags"
		 must be integers, -90 to 90 for lat, 0 to 360 for lon
     Non-user defined input: 
     	"atm_comp_mct_template_F90" & "make_namelist.sh"
     Execution: 
        ./make_tag.sh 
     Outputs: 
        "atm_comp_mct.F90", which incorporate a section of code to tag water species evaporated from different regions 
	"user_nl_cam", which sets up the namelist for tagged water species
     ("make_namelist.sh" can be run individually to create only "user_nl_cam")
     
3.  Next, copy the generated "atm_comp_mct.F90" file into your SourceMods/src.cam directory.
    This file is where the actual water tracer boundaries are specified, and will
    thus need to be modified for any additional water tracers. These additions are
    located in the "atm_import_mct" subroutine, in the "wtrc_nsrfvap" do-loop.

4.  Then, add the line "-water_tag_num N" to the "CAM_CONFIG_OPTS" variable in your case's env_build.xml
    file, where "N" is the number of water tracers you are using. You can find total number of water species M in "user_nl_cam" (e.g. number of "wtrc_srfvap_names" = M). N = M - 4 (the 4 species H2O, H216O, H218O and HDO are the default, not tagged species)

5.  Finally, copy "user_nl_cam" file into your case directory and add other user-defined namelist settings if any.
    In user_nl_cam, for every new water tracer that is added, location tags and tracer names are specified.
    An additional 7 "H2O" quantities are added to the "wtrc_species_names" variable, and an additional series of "VAPOR, LIQUID, ICE, etc." to the "wtrc_type_names" variable.

6.  Build the model (run *.build script in case directory).

7.  Run the model  (use either the *.run or *.submit script in case directory).

8.  Once the model is finished running, you should find variables with the same names you provided in user_nl_cam
    in the history files that contain the associated water mass quantities for your water tracer.

Good luck!
